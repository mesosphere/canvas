# Body Text

Body copy, text wrapped in a simple `<p>` tag, lays the foundation for all other text attributes and elements.  Every element of body copy, and really any text, is definable by canvas.

## Lead Text

Increase the importance of your body copy by adding the class `.lead`. Lead is only a class, and not an HTML tag, but may be useful when you want to retain the semantic nature of a paragraph, but are not willing to classify it as a heading.

## Small Text

For less important body text, add the class `.small`. Small text is useful for legal fine-print, instructional text, or supporting details.

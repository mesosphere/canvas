Badges are a lightweight method of annotating or labeling content. Wrap content in the `.badge` class to add an inline badge. The font-size and line-height of a badge inherit from that of it's parent's properties.

<div class="panel flush-bottom">

  <div class="panel-cell">

    <span class="badge">

      Badge

    </span>

  </div>

  <div class="panel-cell panel-cell-light panel-cell-code-block" markdown="1">

```html
<span class="badge">

</span>
```

  </div>

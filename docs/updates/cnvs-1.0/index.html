      What's new in version 1.0

    </h2>

    <dl>

      <dt>

        Shift in naming for screen-width breakpoints.

      </dt>

      <dd>

        In prior versions of CNVS, there were 5 screen-width break-points, each with a unique name used in class names and variables: portrait phones &lt; 480px (<em>default</em>), landscape phones ≥ 480px (<code>mini</code>), tablets ≥ 768px (<code>small</code>), desktops ≥ 992px (<code>medium</code>), desktops ≥ 1400px (<code>large</code>).  Notice screens below 480px were assumed default and not given an explicit name.  In CNVS 1.0, the identifier <code>mini</code> &emdash; previously assigned to Landscape phones ≥ 480px, now applies to screens below 480px (portrait phones). With this change, the new screen-width break-points are as follows: portrait phones &lt; 480px (<code>mini</code>), landscape phones ≥ 480px (<code>small</code>), tablets ≥ 768px (<code>medium</code>), desktops ≥ 992px (<code>large</code>), desktops ≥ 1400px (<code>jumbo</code>).

      </dd>

      <dt>

        Dropped support for the <code>.container-pod</code> class.

      </dt>

      <dd>



      </dd>

      <dt>

        Dropped support for the <code>.row-pod</code> class.

      </dt>

      <dd>



      </dd>

      <dt>

        Pod behavior now uses margin instead of padding for spacing.

      </dt>

      <dd>

        Pod behavior, previously employed by <code>.container-pod</code> and <code>.row-pod</code> &emdash; now use by the generalized <code>.pod</code>class &emdash; uses margin for spacing rather than padding.  This may result in issues with elements wrapping/containing pods.  Using a simple <code>clearfix</code> will typically resolve these issues.

      </dd>

      <dt>

        The new class <code>.button-block</code> behaves like the class <code>.button-wide</code>.

      </dt>

      <dd>

        The class <code>.button-wide</code> previously forced a button element to behave as a block element.  There were additional class modifiers that would force this behavior only below certain screen-width breakpoints.  This behavior has been reapporiated to the class <code>.button-block</code>.  The class <code>.button-wide</code> now adjust the horizontal padding inside a button to be wider.

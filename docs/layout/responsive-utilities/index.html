      Most content and components in CNVS support responsive behavior for scaling either size or spacing.  However, you'll often want to hide and show specific elements of your project based on a given screen resolution.  Similarly, when optimizing your project for printing, you may wish to hide or show components.  Use these useful pre-defined classes to trigger responsive behavior.

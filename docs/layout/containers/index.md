In Canvas, containers can be used independent of the [Grid System](/layout/grid). Properties such as a width and margin for the container vary depending on both the class and screen resolution. Choose from a responsive, fixed-width container (meaning its max-width changes at each breakpoint) or fluid-width (meaning itâ€™s 100% wide all the time).

{% include layout/containers/containers-fixed.md %}
{% include layout/containers/containers-fluid.md %}
